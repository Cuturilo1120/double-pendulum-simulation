# Double Pendulum Simulation

## Project Information

Curse name: **Napredne Tehnike Programiranja**

Target Grade: **6**

### Grade 6 Requirements

* Implement a **sequential version** of the chosen problem in Python.
* Implement a **parallelized version** using the `multiprocessing` library in Python.
* Save at least one **output file** representing the state of the modeled system (by iterations).

## Chosen Topic: Double Pendulum Simulation

The **double pendulum** is a classic problem in physics and computational science.

Despite its simple setup (two pendulums connected end-to-end), it demonstrates **complex and chaotic motion**.

This makes it a suitable and interesting choice for illustrating high-performance computing concepts:

* **Sequential simulation** (baseline implementation).
* **Parallel simulation** (distributing computations with multiprocessing).
